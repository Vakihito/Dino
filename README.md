# -Dino
<p>this aplication is similtar to the 'chrome//dino' game made by google, so I reacreated this game using 'pygames', and that's the reason why i'm using python2<p>
 <br/>
 <p>In order to make dinosaurs that evolve I've used a genetic algorithm.</p>
 <br/>
 
 <p>so first open the file test, and than you can test out this game with the code: </p><code>python2 t2.py</code>
 <br/>
 <p>to check the dinos lerning you can do : </p><code>python2 theGameIsOn.py</code>
